    "- **Purpose**: Method inheritance is incredibly helpful for:\n",
    "    - Grouping related functionality: Common behaviors can be defined once in a superclass.\n",

    "**How Python Finds Methods (Method Resolution Order - MRO)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When a method is called on an instance (e.g., ```my_object.some_method()```), Python follows a specific search order to find the method:\n",
    "1. It first searches for the method in the instance's own class.\n",
    "2. If not found there, it then searches in its immediate superclass.\n",
    "3. This process continues up the inheritance hierarchy (following the Method Resolution Order - MRO) until the method is found or a ```NameError``` is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Role of ```self```: When a method (whether defined in the subclass or inherited from the superclass) is called on an instance, ```self``` will always refer to the specific instance that is calling the method. This ensures that even inherited methods operate on the correct object's data."

Essentially, the subclass method has the exact same name (and usually signature) as the superclass method, but contains different or expanded logic.\n",

Polymorphism (meaning \"many forms\") is a core principle of object-oriented programming where objects of different classes can respond to the same method call in different ways, based on their specific type.
