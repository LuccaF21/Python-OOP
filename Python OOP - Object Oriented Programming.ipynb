    "1. \"Protected\" Methods (Single Leading Underscore ```_```)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convention: To follow Python naming conventions, if you want to indicate that a method is \"protected\" and should not be called directly from outside the class, you add a single leading underscore to its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: ```def _calculate_total(self)```:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: Python does not technically prevent you from calling ```my_object._calculate_total()```. This is a \"gentleman's agreement\" among developers. It signals that if you call it from outside, you're bypassing the intended interface and might encounter issues if the internal implementation changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Private\" Methods (Double Leading Underscore ```__```)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Purpose: Adding two leading underscores to the name of the method will trigger the process of name mangling. This is primarily used to prevent name clashes with methods in subclasses, not to enforce strict privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name Mangling: Python renames the method internally to ```_ClassName__method_name``` (e.g., ```__display_data``` becomes ```_MyClass__display_data```).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: ```def __prepare_report(self)```:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior: While name mangling makes it harder, you can still technically call the method from outside using its mangled name (e.g., ```my_object._MyClass__prepare_report()```). This is strongly discouraged."
